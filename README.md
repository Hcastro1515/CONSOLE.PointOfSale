# CONSOLE.PointOfSale

A small kebab shop hired the C# Academy team to create a simple app that will serve as point of sale. 
Since their budget is only 2$ we've decided to make a Console App. 

The app should have a list with 10 types of kebab and should be user friendly and very fast, since this shop is
very popular and queues can get quite long.
